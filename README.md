# python-macroboard
This script lets you use a secondary keyboard purely for macro keys, by adding the modifier keys Shift+Ctrl+Meta+Alt to all the key presses on this device. 

A GUI tool which will let you remap keys to use alternate modifiers (in case of compatibility problems) or send completely different key codes altogether will follow.
